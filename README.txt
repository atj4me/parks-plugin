Wordpress Plugin to manage Parks

== Description ==
## WordPress Parks Management Plugin

This WordPress plugin offers a comprehensive solution for managing and displaying information about parks. It introduces a custom post type called \"Parks,\" implements a custom taxonomy for categorizing park facilities, and provides a shortcode for easy display of park listings. 

### Custom Post Type: Parks

The plugin registers a custom post type called \"Parks,\" allowing users to easily add and manage park entries. Each park entry includes the following fields:

1. Name: The official name of the park
2. Location: The physical address or coordinates of the park
3. Hours: Separate fields for weekday and weekend operating hours
4. Short description: A brief overview of the park\'s features and attractions

This structure enables administrators to input detailed information about each park in a organized and consistent manner.

### Custom Taxonomy: Facilities

To enhance park categorization and improve user experience, the plugin implements a custom taxonomy called \"Facilities.\" This taxonomy allows parks to be categorized based on the amenities they offer, such as:

– Ice Rink
– Leash-Free Zone
– Water Fountain
– Playground
– Picnic Area
– Sports Fields
– Hiking Trails

The Facilities taxonomy is seamlessly integrated into the park post editor interface, making it easy for administrators to assign relevant facilities to each park entry.

### Shortcode: [park_list]

The plugin includes a versatile shortcode [park_list] that generates a styled list of all parks. When placed on any page or post, this shortcode displays park information in an attractive and user-friendly format. Each park entry in the list shows:

1. Park Name
2. Location
3. Weekday operating hours
4. A truncated version of the park description

This shortcode provides a quick and efficient way to showcase park information to website visitors.

### Styling and Visual Appeal

To ensure the park list is visually appealing and consistent with modern web design standards, the plugin includes basic CSS styling. This styling enhances the readability and overall aesthetic of the park listings, making the information more engaging for users.

### Additional Features and Benefits

1. Customization: The plugin is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing developers to easily customize and expand its functionality.
2. User-friendly: The intuitive admin interface makes it simple for non-technical users to manage park information.
3. SEO-friendly: The custom post type and taxonomy structure contributes to better search engine optimization for park-related content.
4. Mobile-responsive: The generated park list is designed to be responsive, ensuring a great user experience on all devices.
5. Performance-optimized: The plugin is built with WordPress best practices in mind, ensuring it doesn\'t negatively impact website performance.

This Parks Management Plugin streamlines the process of managing and displaying park information on WordPress websites, providing an efficient solution for organizations looking to showcase their recreational areas online.
